            <b>Portland</b> is a parish on the northeast coast of the island of Jamaica. Port Antonio is the small, laid-back capital, with faded colonial-era mansions lining the Titchfield Peninsula. Sandy beaches fringe the forested coast between the city and the deep waters of the Blue Lagoon farther east. Inland, bamboo rafts ply the Rio Grande river. 
            Trails cross the Blue Mountains, known for their coffee plantations.
