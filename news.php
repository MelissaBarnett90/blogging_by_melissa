            <b>Refugees Harness the Power of Storytelling</b>
Jordan | Built around the belief that everyone has a right to tell their own stories, an organization in Jordan is hosting mindfulness, creative writing and public-speaking workshops for more than 1,500 refugees. The sessions, which have also been held in cities across Turkey, Lebanon and Germany, are hosted by #MeWe International. The non-profit was founded in 2014 and helps participants work through severe trauma brought on by discrimination and, in many cases, violence.

According to New York-based founder Mohsin Mohi Ud Din, the key to the workshops is that they are taught by other refugees, creating a unique community that’s “for the people, by the people.”

The results are compelling, he says: participants have reported reduced aggression and improved communication skills. At the end of the sessions, they’re invited to tell their stories through theatre productions, book projects and the like.
